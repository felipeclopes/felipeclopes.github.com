I pretend to be bloggin often about Rails, Startups and anything that comes to my mind.

## Posts

{% assign posts_collate = site.posts %}
{% include JB/posts_collate %}

## To-Do

I'm using Jekyll Bootstrap to blog, If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
There are a lot of things to do, like clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
